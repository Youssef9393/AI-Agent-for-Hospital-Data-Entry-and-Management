🏥 About the Project

I’m developing a server MCP (Model Context Protocol) designed to perform web searches on Moroccan hospital websites, automatically collect and store the extracted information in a database, and then provide secure access to the data and file system through Claude.

This system aims to:

🔍 Automate data collection from official Moroccan hospital websites

🧠 Organize and index hospital-related information in a structured database

🗄️ Enable intelligent query and file access via Claude integration

⚙️ Serve as a foundation for medical data analytics and information retrieval
